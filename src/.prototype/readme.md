# philosophy.space

- a list of programs organized by the degrees offered
- a list of faculty specializations
- a list of departmental orientations
- a list of links to examples of faculty writing

- sortable by location and what not (pagination, projection; i.e., skip and limit, filtered, etc.; i.e., [hypermediated][hyper]; navigable by url; e.g., with curl)
- update it yearly as faculty are added or removed ([systematically enforce][enforce] and notify according to [conway's 4 laws][conway])
- add a section that lists whether the faculty member is accepting new students (enable agents to update any schema.org/Offer; i.e, odrl)
- add a utility section that had things like funding (see previous)
- kinds of insurance they offer
- average rent in the area (geolocation requirements; dependency on [third-party apis][monetize] like google, etc.; see risks of not [monetizing][twitter])
- unionization (third-party web scraping? apis?)
- other USEFULSHIT beyond whatever the clout economy has deemed "good." (socially-enforced rating system, systematically enforced)
- incidences of violence within the department (reason: it doesn't matter how "good" a department is if you're not safe to do work there)
- folks who're going to spend a good chunk of their lives working in this space (temporal and aging microdata which visually communicates liveness of offers, agents, etc.)
- clout and prestige might be good, but working in a safe, supportive environment is invaluable (de-prioritize clout and prestige scores based on socially-enforced ratings such that discoverable safety microdata de-ranks/de-lists some opportunities)
- job placement rates (printable and mobile-friendly reporting features)
- job placement is a fucking crapshoot and the only things that improve your chances are clout (subviable, optional: social media api interactions)

## built-to-last but make it fashion

i don't build anything, if i must be caught "building", without [jumpstarting the decolonial engine][jumpstart] in [mind][mind]. thanks for the html (or concept of "linking relation"), timbl, but "fun" and "right" are vacuous system-level [software quality properties][quality] to target for the anything, particularly a world-wide web (lookin' at you, "native apps"). consider this the last manifesto of cyberspace. the web is not yet another [idealized conceptual noun][verbs] to me to let [grow][grow] ignored (and i don't care what bill gates [thinks][gates])

before we start, caveat emptor &mdash; and no, i am not (just) using this space to rant about blockchains:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">UX design is misleading in how it uses the User word to mask the Business word. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a vanity role for employers. Here&#39;s the realities of what the role entails in a graph. <a href="https://t.co/jfXvUYpEkx">pic.twitter.com/jfXvUYpEkx</a></p>&mdash; Stephen Farrugia (@fasterandworse) <a href="https://twitter.com/fasterandworse/status/1528748399528398851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2022</a></blockquote> 

none of what i'm suggesting here requires that one model this project like a business; but of course you should be aware of what the "opponent" is thinking when they ruminate on the market surface. an obvious "threat", or attack vector, is buyout, and as i've pointed out elsewhere, if you build your "app" (or website) in a way that is not "[cool][cool]" or "hard" or "built-to-last", capital will find a way to plunder and undermine your teleology, no matter how well-intentioned. "cool", "hard", and "built-to-last" are not just throw-away terms i'm using here: *their senses are historically and politically truthbearing*.

![what if we AUDITED THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS STEALING OUR PRIVACY? in the WORLD-WILD WEB?; accessibility: archive.ph/gs7jD; semantics: archive.ph/rkWiy; vocabularies: archive.ph/at6QJ](https://github.com/nerdfiles/philosophy-io/raw/master/assets/audits--6nrlsz.jpg "with what must the quality of existence begin?")

## <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration_of_future_consequences">considerations for consequences</a>

1. web design is a mistake, and [the text(-object) is mobile-friendly][mf]
2. [accessibility][a11y][<sup>a11y</sup>][ux] is [security and privacy][security]. over 90% of the web is inaccessible. this is an ecological disaster which we, as a species, cannot continue to ignore. *no*, we cannot "fix it later" because we insist on "setting it and forgetting it" even with our "distributed domain-driven designs" (see eric evans)
3. DO NOT USE A BLOCKCHAIN [ANTI-COMPUTER][anticomputer] (WITH ANY [HASH-CRACKING ALGORITHM][hashcracking] YOU WILL UNDERMINE MONETIZATION EFFORTS AND ONLY INTRODUCE [A SISYPHEAN BOULDER][sisyphean]): the *promise* of names that are ["unusable" and that are not "memorable"][primer] (*to humans*) is a *ontological axiom*. it is *unethical* to uncritically design and philosophically ground technology architectures in humanism without having read the wealth of critique against humanism stemming not only from black authors but also media philosophers. *no*.
4. ward against [technology monopoly][techmonopoly]
5. don't build (economic) [traps][trap]: use ([html+css][htmlcss])\*hypermedia where and when possible as a goto solution space. use of quick and dirty "[tools][goto]" like wordpress, even djano, or whatever is not your ally. tools introduce intellectual, [monetary][money], linguistic, and [legal][legal] [barriers][gov] (the article is a joke, but where's the lie, given everything i have here outlined above?)
6. use [verbs][verbs] (algorithmic economics; not just the [http ones][httpverbs])
7. review [the code of capital][codeofcapital]
8. if you must get a static website running, try surge dot sh
9. ignore paul cockshott, a reductionist
10. ignore stephen pinker, the stinker, if you can
11. daniel dennett is not a spinozist (stop trying to make that a thing)

think of the laws

![whose law is it anyway? CAMPBELL'S LAW; GRESHAM'S LAW; POSTEL'S LAW; MOORE'S LAW](https://github.com/nerdfiles/philosophy-io/raw/master/assets/laws--6jjcd1.jpg "you don't just 'fix the laws'")
