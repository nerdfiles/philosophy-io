# philosophy.space

- a list of programs organized by the degrees offered
- a list of faculty specializations
- a list of departmental orientations
- a list of links to examples of faculty writing

- sortable by location and what not (pagination, projection; i.e., skip and limit, filtered, etc.; i.e., [hypermediated][hyper]; navigable by url; e.g., with curl)
- update it yearly as faculty are added or removed ([systematically enforce][enforce] and notify according to [conway's 4 laws][conway])
- add a section that lists whether the faculty member is accepting new students (enable agents to update any schema.org/Offer; i.e, odrl)
- add a utility section that had things like funding (see previous)
- kinds of insurance they offer
- average rent in the area (geolocation requirements; dependency on [third-party apis][monetize] like google, etc.; see risks of not [monetizing][twitter])
- unionization (third-party web scraping? apis?)
- other USEFULSHIT beyond whatever the clout economy has deemed "good." (socially-enforced rating system, systematically enforced)
- incidences of violence within the department (reason: it doesn't matter how "good" a department is if you're not safe to do work there)
- folks who're going to spend a good chunk of their lives working in this space (temporal and aging microdata which visually communicates liveness of offers, agents, etc.)
- clout and prestige might be good, but working in a safe, supportive environment is invaluable (de-prioritize clout and prestige scores based on socially-enforced ratings such that discoverable safety microdata de-ranks/de-lists some opportunities)
- job placement rates (printable and mobile-friendly reporting features)
- job placement is a fucking crapshoot and the only things that improve your chances are clout (subviable, optional: social media api interactions)

## built-to-last but make it fashion

some considerations:

1. web design is a mistake, and [the text(-object) is mobile-friendly][mf]
2. [accessibility][a11y][<sup>a11y</sup>][ux] is [security and privacy][security]. over 90% of the web is inaccessible. this is an ecological disaster which we, as a species, cannot continue to ignore. *no*, we cannot "fix it later" because we insist on "setting it and forgetting it" even with our "distributed domain-driven designs" (see eric evans)
3. DO NOT USE A BLOCKCHAIN (WITH ANY [HASH-CRACKING ALGORITHM][hashcracking] YOU WILL UNDERMIN MONETIZATION EFFORTS AND ONLY INTRODUCE [A SISYPHEAN BOULDER][sisyphean]): the *promise* of names that are ["unsable" and that are not "memorable"][primer] (*to humans*) is a *ontological axiom*. it is *unethical* to uncritically design and philosophically ground technology architectures in humanism without having read the wealth of critique against humanism stemming not only from black authors but also media philosophers. *no*.
